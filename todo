- Wrap up audio

- save states


# odin stuff

default_allocator :: heap_allocator
default_allocator_proc :: heap_allocator_proc

heap allocator has no data of what is storing so u can't know what was allocated, and how many bytes were allocated


	Default_Temp_Allocator :: struct {
		arena: Arena,
	}

temp allocator is an arena
core/mem/allocators.odin


- figure out how to figure out how much allocators are allocating
- does the temp allocator even exist if u don't init it?


# Input

write 1 -> $4016: signal controller to poll its input
write 0 -> $4016: signal controller to finish its poll

read $4016 or $4017: reads controller input (port 0 or 1), one bit at a time
	reads highest bit only. then it left shifts by one bit
	reads right shifts bits by one

order of inputs:

(highest bit) -> lowest bit

A B Select Start Up Down Left Right

# possible bug

when i was playing mario and i went rainbow mode, this happened:

# notes compared to javidx

it seems he has the same sprite misalignment as me.
sprites are one pixel to the left. or more.
also they are one pixel up. i checked

see this for reference

# Todo

- the hack u did to place sprites better causes problems.
u are adding to x to a u8 so it will wrap. so sprites show up on the left when they're off screen

- don't allocate memory for the whole bus.
 the bus is a fake thing. it's not ram
 put actual ram in separate fields. it's easier.


# cpu timing

u gotta do the extra cycles on the addressing modes

for relative, it's an instruction thing. depends if it succeeds or not

so how do u do it

just havea variable in the nes that u set to 0 before running the instruction
and the branching instructions can touch that
