# Testing

- just do mapper_000 since it will work for the test rom and donkey kong

## odin stuff

default_allocator :: heap_allocator
default_allocator_proc :: heap_allocator_proc

heap allocator has no data of what is storing so u can't know what was allocated, and how many bytes were allocated


	Default_Temp_Allocator :: struct {
		arena: Arena,
	}

temp allocator is an arena
core/mem/allocators.odin


- figure out how to figure out how much allocators are allocating
- does the temp allocator even exist if u don't init it?


## Todo

- mappers
- do mapper 000	 (nrom)
- programming nrom
https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Programming_NROM

prg rom: program rom. probably the cpu code
chr rom: "character" rom. it's the graphics. for the PPU. sprites and backgrounds


- is it nes 2.0 or ines?
    it's ines.
