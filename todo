# Testing

- just do mapper_000 since it will work for the test rom and donkey kong

## odin stuff

default_allocator :: heap_allocator
default_allocator_proc :: heap_allocator_proc

heap allocator has no data of what is storing so u can't know what was allocated, and how many bytes were allocated


	Default_Temp_Allocator :: struct {
		arena: Arena,
	}

temp allocator is an arena
core/mem/allocators.odin


- figure out how to figure out how much allocators are allocating
- does the temp allocator even exist if u don't init it?


## Todo


# PPU

- do a test run of donkey kong to see how it uses the registers.
- implement enough PPU stuff so that donkey kong can draw its own backgrounds.

status register:

See: PPU rendering for more information on the timing of setting and clearing the flags.


- how do i set all the flags? or like how do i make sure that the flags are set correctly when read?


- what is nmi?
